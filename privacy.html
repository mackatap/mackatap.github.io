			<p>
				<a href="https://www.fancade.com">Super Sock Kid</a> is developed
				by <a href="https://www.mackatap.com">Mackatap</a>. We know
				privacy and security is important to our users and this Privacy Policy
				will help you understand what information we collect, why we need it,
				and what we do with it. By using Super Sock Kid you agree to this policy and
				the <a href="https://www.mackatap.com/terms/">Terms of Use</a>.
			</p>

			<h3>Super Sock Kid Account</h3>
			<p>
				If you choose to, you may connect using a Google account, creating a Super Sock Kid account that lets you sign in and access
				your purchases from your other devices. The account you provide is not
				visible to other Super Sock Kid users and will not be used to send you spam!
			</p>
			<p>
				Creating a Super Sock Kid account enables you to publish games you've made! The
				game, and the nick name you choose to publish as, will be
				visible to other users, so don't include any information that you do not
				wish to be public.
			</p>
			<p>
				Super Sock Kid uses Google Firebase to provide these services and you
				can <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/">find more
				information here</a>.
			</p>

			<h3>Analytics</h3>
			<p>
				In order to improve Super Sock Kid we may collect usage statistics, such as the
				number of users, how often they play, and whether anyone actually buys
				anything. Super Sock Kid uses Google Analytics for Firebase to collect this
				analytics data and you
				can <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">find
				more information here</a>.
			</p>

			<h3>Personalized Ads</h3>
			<p>
				You may choose to play Super Sock Kid games for free, with ads. Your device has
				an Advertising Identifier and the ad provider uses this identifier, and
				information they have collected about you, to select content that is
				more likely to actually be of interest to you. Ads are entirely optional
				and you can opt out by using the mobile app's in-app purchases instead.
				Super Sock Kid uses Google AdMob and Google AdSense to provide ads and you can
				<a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">find more
				information here</a>.
			</p>

			<h3>Cookies</h3>
			<p>
				A "cookie" is just a text file stored by your browser when you visit a
				web site. Super Sock Kid uses cookies, and related local storage technologies,
				to remember game progress and settings between play sessions. Similarly,
				Google uses cookies to remember information between visists when serving
				ads, as <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">desribed
				here</a>. Cookies can be cleared, or completely disabled, using your
				browser settings.
			</p>

			<h3>Crash Logs</h3>
			<p>
				We do our best to find and fix software bugs before publishing new
				versions of the app. But, realistically, some bugs will slip through and
				may cause the Super Sock Kid app to crash. If this happens the app may send a
				crash log to help us find and fix the bug! Super Sock Kid uses Google
				Crashlytics to collect crash logs and you
				can <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">find more
				information here</a>.
			</p>

			<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
			<p>
				You must be 13 years of age or older to use Super Sock Kid. We do not knowingly
				collect personal information from children under 13. Moreover, if you
				are younger than 18, then your parent or legal guardian must read and
				accept this Privacy Policy and
				the <a href="https://www.mackatap.com/terms/">Terms of Use</a> on your
				behalf.
			</p>

			<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
			<p>
				We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time and will notify you
				of any changes by publishing the new policy on this page. Any changes
				are effective immediately on publishing and you are advised to review
				this page periodically.
